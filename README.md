# Carpentries Instructor Training

I'm taking the Instructor Training for the Carpentries and it requires a short (90-second) introduction to an episode on one of the Carpentry lessons pages. That introduction (to my mind) *must* include at least some example code so I'm writing that in this repository.

Additionally, I think there may be some follow-along coding in the training and it could be helpful to have my own repository for that (if one is not already set up for us in advance).

The episode I selected to teach a short intro on was "[Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html)". The lesson's GitHub repository is linked [here](https://github.com/datacarpentry/R-ecology-lesson)
